  <p>The code for our custom shape examples has so far been rather tedious. We have manually created shapes by typing line after line of vertex function calls, and this strategy won’t work for more complex shapes. Also, given the title of the book, this approach might seem a bit anti-climatic. Now that we understand the basics of <code>beginShape()</code>, let’s have a first look at how to procedurally draw custom shapes using a for loop, and the <code>sin()</code> and <code>cos()</code> functions.</p>

  <section data-type="sect1">

    <h1>Sine and Cosine</h1>

    <p>Over the years, I’ve seen many students struggle with Sine and Cosine. It’s easy to understand why: These words seem rather scary and abstract, especially if you don’t consider yourself good at math. However, this is both unfortunate and unnecessary. Unfortunate, because these two functions are a fundamental part of most programmatic designs, and a good understanding of them will allow you to solve many visual problems. Unnecessary, because they are not that hard to learn. Even if you don’t understand everything presented in this chapter, you can get started by memorizing two almost identical lines of code.</p>

    <p>Simply put, Sine and Cosine allow us to find any position on the outline of an ellipse. They do this by converting an angle into an <code>x</code> position (Cosine) or a <code>y</code> position (Sine) for a circle with a 1 pixel radius. These values can then be multiplied by the radius of your actual circle to scale them up. Although it’s not strictly necessary to understand how these functions work internally, here’s a way to visualize what’s going on: Imagine a right sided triangle connecting the center of the circle to the point on the outline. The Sine function is simply a quick way to get the ratio between the left side (hypotenuse) and the right side (opposite) of that triangle. The Cosine function is likewise the ratio between the hypotenuse and the bottom side (adjacent) of the triangle.</p>

        <text x="487" y="210">Sine finds y</text>
      </svg>
    </figure>

    <p>In P5, these functions are called <code>sin()</code> and <code>cos()</code>. As described above, they accept a single argument – an angle in radians – and return a value between <code>-1</code> and <code>1</code> representing the <code>x</code> or <code>y</code> position on a tiny circle. The two lines below demonstrate how to get these values and multiply them by the radius of your actual circle. Memorize these two lines, as they are very important.</p>

    <pre class="text-width"><code>var x = cos(RADIANS) * RADIUS;
var y = sin(RADIANS) * RADIUS;</code></pre>


    <p>To put this into context, here’s an example where we use the same code to draw a small circle 330 degrees along the outline of a bigger circle.</p>

    <div class="grid">
      <div class="col-1-2">
        {% codesplit shape/procedural-shapes/circles.js lines:'6-13' %}

        {% p5 shape/procedural-shapes/circles.js class:'fig' %}
      </figure>
    </div>

    <p>If you consider all the basic shapes – as well as many complex shapes – they are characterized by having non-overlapping outlines that move around a center point. Some shapes, like the triangle, have just a few vertices, while others – like the ellipse – have many vertices. The <code>sin()</code> and <code>cos()</code> functions simply give a way to procedurally draw these types of shapes.</p>

    <h1>The For Loop</h1>

    <p>Although we will dedicate an entire part of this book to repetition, let’s briefly go over the basic functionality of a <code>for</code> loop. A <code>for</code> loop allows us to execute code multiple times in a row by incrementing (or decrementing) a variable – often called <code>i</code> – until an expression is no longer true and the loop stops. In the following example, we initialize a variable with the number <code>0</code>, iterate as long as our variable is lower than <code>10</code>, and increment our variable by one between each iteration. The result is a loop that iterates ten times with our variable incrementing from zero to nine, drawing ten rectangles on the screen.</p>

    <div class="grid">
      <div class="col-1-2">
        {% codesplit shape/procedural-shapes/for.js lines:'7-9' %}
      </div>
      <figure class="col-1-2">
        {% p5 shape/procedural-shapes/for.js class:'fig' %}
      </figure>
    </div>

    <p>Unfortunately, all these rectangles have identical positions and sizes because we’re passing the same static numbers to the <code>rect()</code> function over and over again. This is where <code>i</code> comes into play: Because it changes between each iteration of the loop, it can be used to create variance between each rectangle. The example below uses <code>i</code> to position the ten rectangles one pixel apart on the x-axis.</p>

    <div class="grid">
      <div class="col-1-2">
        {% codesplit shape/procedural-shapes/for-i.js lines:'7-9' %}
      </div>
      <figure class="col-1-2">
        {% p5 shape/procedural-shapes/for-i.js class:'fig' %}
      </figure>
    </div>

    <p>Although it might not be immediately clear, this is an important technique when drawing procedural designs. Because <code>i</code> increments by one between each iteration, it can be used as a scalar to distribute shapes across the canvas. For example, if we want to position the rectangles next to each other, we can simply multiply <code>i</code> with the width of the rectangles.</p>

    <div class="grid">
      <div class="col-1-2">
        {% codesplit shape/procedural-shapes/for-i-multiply.js lines:'7-9' %}
      </div>
      <figure class="col-1-2">
        {% p5 shape/procedural-shapes/for-i-multiply.js class:'fig' %}
      </figure>
    </div>

    <p>We can use this same technique to draw custom shapes. Instead of drawing individual shapes in the loop, we simply use the for loop to procedurally add vertices between the <code>beginShape()</code> and <code>endShape()</code> function calls. In the example below, we use this technique to place ten vertices randomly around the center of the canvas.</p>

    <div class="grid">
      <div class="col-1-2">
        {% codesplit shape/procedural-shapes/for-random.js lines:'8-15' %}
      </div>
      <figure class="col-1-2">
        {% p5 shape/procedural-shapes/for-random.js class:'fig' %}
      </figure>
    </div>

    <p>The result is certainly a procedural shape, but the use of <code>random()</code> doesn’t give us a lot of control over the placement of the vertices: The shape is just a bunch of lines randomly crossing each other. The final step is to put our two techniques together and generate shapes with <code>sin()</code> and <code>cos()</code> inside of a <code>for</code> loop.</p>

    <h1>Putting it together</h1>

    <p>Starting from our random shape code above, let’s try to replace the random vertices with vertices placed sequentially along the outline of an ellipse. We do this by using the same two lines that we memorized earlier, but instead of passing the same angle to <code>sin()</code> and <code>cos()</code>, we calculate a different angle on every iteration by multiplying <code>i</code> with the angle we want between the vertices. The result is a shape with ten vertices evenly spread around the center of the canvas.</p>

    <div class="grid">
      <div class="col-1-2">
        {% codesplit shape/procedural-shapes/for-sincos.js lines:'8-15' %}
      </div>
      <figure class="col-1-2">
        {% p5 shape/procedural-shapes/for-sincos.js class:'fig' %}
      </figure>
    </div>

    <p>Simply by changing the number of iterations and the spacing between the vertices, you can draw all of the basic shapes. The code below adds a few variables on top of the sketch to automatically calculate the spacing based on the number of vertices. Simply change the numVertices variable and another shape will appear.</p>

    <div class="grid">
      <div class="col-1-2">
        {% codesplit shape/procedural-shapes/for-sincos2.js lines:'8-17' %}
      </div>
      <figure class="col-1-2">
        {% p5 shape/procedural-shapes/for-sincos2.js class:'fig' %}
      </figure>
    </div>

    <p>‘Great, we have reinvented the basic shape functions’ you might say. Actually, this technique allows us to draw much more sophisticated shapes. In the example below, we change the radius between each iteration of the loop to create a star shape.</p>

    <div class="grid">
      <div class="col-1-2">
        {% codesplit shape/procedural-shapes/star.js lines:'8-23' %}
      </div>
      <figure class="col-1-2">
        {% p5 shape/procedural-shapes/star.js class:'fig' %}
      </figure>
    </div>

    <p>We can also draw many closely spaced vertices and randomize the radius for each of them, drawing a squiggly circle that appears to be drawn by hand.</p>

    <div class="grid">
      <div class="col-1-2">
        {% codesplit shape/procedural-shapes/squiggly.js lines:'8-17' %}
      </div>
      <figure class="col-1-2">
        {% p5 shape/procedural-shapes/squiggly.js class:'fig' %}
      </figure>
    </div>

    <p>Here’s a flower created with <code>quadraticVertex()</code> where all vertices and control points are positioned using <code>sin()</code> and <code>cos()</code>. When using Bézier curves, you need to remember to start the shape with a <code>vertex()</code> function call. We do this by checking the value of <code>i</code> within the loop.</p>

    <div class="grid">
      <div class="col-1-2">
        {% codesplit shape/procedural-shapes/flower.js lines:'8-30' %}

      <figure class="col-1-2">
        {% p5 shape/procedural-shapes/flower.js class:'fig' %}
      </figure>
    </div>

    <p>The two shapes below are created using just one of the circular functions: The first one uses <code>sin()</code> and the second one uses <code>cos()</code>. Notice how we multiply <code>i</code> with a larger value to calculate the <code>x</code> of each vertex, but use a very small value to calculate the angle passed to <code>sin()</code> and <code>cos()</code>.</p>

    <div class="grid">
      <div class="col-1-2">

        {% codesplit shape/procedural-shapes/wave-cos.js lines:'8-18' %}
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>This wobbly shape is created by adding a Sine curve on top of the radius for every vertex. Also notice how we use a different radius for <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> to create an ellipse that is wider than tall.</p>

    <p>Sine and Cosine can be used to create a range of different shapes during the design process. In this design by Josef Müller-Brockmann, a series of exponentially growing arcs are rotated around the bottom left of the canvas.</p>

    <p>This chapter introduced an approach to design that is inherently different than a traditional design process. Rather than individually placing each shape on the canvas, we wrote algorithms to do this for us. Using loops to procedurally draw shapes is a powerful concept, as it allows designers to do more with less code, thus alleviating us from the pains of manually constructing every design object by hand. This is also the hardest thing about procedural design, as designers need to devote more time up front distilling the system into code, and they can’t easily manipulate individual shapes like in a traditional design tool. The American computer scientist Donald Knuth calls this a transition from design to meta-design:</p>

    <blockquote class="media-width">
      <p>&ldquo;Meta-design is much more difficult than design; it’s easier to draw something than to explain how to draw it. […] However, once we have successfully explained how to draw something in a sufficiently general manner, the same explanation will work for related shapes, in different circumstances; so the time spent in formulating a precise explanation turns out to be worth it.&rdquo;</p>
      <cite>Donald Knuth (1986), The Metafont Book</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This approach is an essential part of this book. When designers learn to not only think systematically about the design process, but also to implement those systems in software, they can build things that weren’t possible before.</p>
