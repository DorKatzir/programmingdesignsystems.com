  <p>Effective use of color is vital to the success of any design project. Imagine a yellow Coca-Cola logo or the Mona Lisa painted in a saturated pink, and you might realize that the choice of colors has a drastic impact on any design. This does not mean that colors always have a clear semiotic purpose. While it might be obvious why stop signs are painted red (alert, danger, there will be blood if you ignore this), most color schemes are harder to interpret so directly. This leaves us with an art form that, like graphic design in general, is both objective and subjective. It is objectively a bad idea to use yellow text on a white background, because the lack of contrast makes the text hard to read. Likewise, one should not use red and green as primary colors in a data visualization when approximately 8% of men world-wide suffer from red-green color blindness <span data-type="footnote">Gegenfurtner, Karl. R.; Sharpe, Lindsay. T. (2001) <em>Color Vision: From Genes to Perception</em>, p. 3-11. Cambridge University Press</span>. It is important to know these rules when working with color, as they enable designers to create graphics that are accessible to a majority of users. However, to master the art of color combination, designers also have to know how color is used in different cultures and contexts, observe current trends in the arts, and develop a personal style based on this knowledge. Because of this, many authors have struggled to create good ways of teaching designers how to think about color combination.
  </p>

  <p>One popular method is to create categories of color schemes named after the relationship between the hues of the colors in each scheme. These categories are given names such as complementary (two colors with opposite hues), triadic (three colors spaced evenly across the color spectrum), tetradic (four colors spaced evenly across the color spectrum), and analogous (colors with similar hues). Authors also include a more hybrid set of categories for color schemes that do not fit in any of the former categories. One explanation for the popularity of these approaches might be that teachers can visualize the categories by placing shapes on the color circle, and students can change the dimensions of these shapes to create variations of the color schemes. This technique is described in many books about graphic design, and you will often encounter terms like triadic and tertiary in design critiques.</p>

  <div class="grid">
    {% p5 color/color-schemes/triadic.js class:'col-1-2' caption:'A triadic color scheme with three evenly spaced hues .' %}
    {% p5 color/color-schemes/tetradic.js class:'col-1-2' caption:'A tetradic color scheme with four evenly spaced hues.' %}
  </div>

  <p>Even though this systematic approach might seem like a perfect fit for this book, I believe this method to be highly problematic. One problem is that color schemes within a single category do not have any coherent visual effect. Triadic and tetradic color schemes can look remarkably similar, even identical, if the spacing between hues is tweaked slightly. Also, the visual effect of a pure triadic color scheme in the sRGB color space is very different from the same color scheme in CIELUV. Worst of all, this approach also tends to ignore the saturation and lightness dimensions, which are left for designers to figure out for themselves. A color theory that ignores two-thirds of the color dimensions will not help designers make better decisions.</p>

Instead, this chapter will present a color theory built around the three dimensions of the HSL color model. By focusing on the hue, saturation, and lightness of colors – and how these dimensions interact – designers can learn how changes in code are reflected visually, and compose interesting color combinations from this knowledge. In the following, we will go through these dimensions in reverse order, using the HSLuv library (LINK) to ensure that changes in our code reflect actual perceptual changes in color.

Lightness

The lightness of a color determines how much black is mixed into the color. A color with 0 lightness is black, while a color with 100 lightness is white. Pure colors lie in the middle of this scale with a value of 50 (LINK). The contrast of light and dark is a significant one, and even though we can create contrasts between colors by manipulating any of the HSL dimensions, the term ‘contrast’ most times refers to changes in lightness. The examples below demonstrate the effect of both a low-contrast and a high-contrast color scheme. The first example appears soft and light, which is a result of the high lightness values with small differences in lightness between each color. The second example appears bolder and has a significant positive/negative effect caused by the large differences in lightness for neighbouring colors.

Muriel Cooper was a highly influential graphic designer who did important work in early digital design and user interface design. As co-founder of the MIT Media Lab and Design Director of MIT Press, she oversaw production of more than 500 books, and she is widely known for her black and white designs  Below are two of her more famous designs that rely solely on the lightness dimension.

Choosing a proper contrast is especially important when working with text, as readability is determined by the contrast between text and background. The World Wide Web Consortium recommends in their Web Content Accessibility Guidelines that body text should have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, and they provide the following formula to calculate this contrast ratio.

contrast ratio
(L1 + 0.05) / (L2 + 0.05), where
L1 is the relative luminance of the lighter of the colors, and
L2 is the relative luminance of the darker of the colors.

This formula requires all lightness values to be provided in relative luminance, which refers to the Y dimension in the CIEXYZ color space. To calculate the W3C contrast ratio for a HSLuv color, we therefore first need to convert the lightness value into the CIEXYZ color space, and then use the formula above to calculate the contrast ratio. This is demonstrated in the code example below, where we check the W3C contrast ratio for two HSLuv colors.

function contrastRatio(l1, l2) {
   // lightness to relative luminance
   if (l <= 8) {
    return 1.0 * l / 903.2962962;
   } else {
     return 1.0 * Math.pow((l + 16) / 116, 3);
   }
   // use contrast ration formula!!
}

contrastRatio(50, 60) //=> BAD RESULT
contrastRatio(50, 60) //=> GOOD RESULT

Lightness plays an important role in any color scheme, both when it comes to accessibility and aesthetics. Like the previous exercises in this book, it is recommended that aspiring designers practice designing only in black and white to learn how to establish proper contrast in their designs. ‘What does it look like in black and white’ is a good question to ask if a design seems cluttered, as it can reveal a lack of contrast between shapes in the design.

Saturation

The saturation of a color controls the purity of the color from grayscale (0) to full color (100) (LINK). You can use this dimension to create color combinations that range from the very muted to the extremely bright. The two examples below use the same lightness and hue values, and differ only in their saturation values.

[ block examples ]

In user interface design, saturation is often used to distinguish passive and active interface components. Apple’s iOS operating system utilizes a desaturated color scheme for general interface elements, but fully saturated colors for key actions such as enabled toggle buttons (saturated blue) and app notifications (saturated red). This makes it possible for users to quickly interpret the state of the interface and notice when a new app event happened, like an LED lighting up on an old switchboard.

[ UI examples with muted + fully saturated for callout ]

A good analogy to consider when working with saturations of color is the way many countries have distinct ways of painting houses in their cities.The saturations of these paints can vary greatly, and although these colors do not have any inherent meaning, they do say something about the time, place, and people. Imagine a small village in Japan with its muted, desaturated colors, and compare this to a place like Mexico City, where houses are painted in very pure, saturated colors. These colors reflect the culture around them, and you should consider your content in the same way: Does it demand lively colors or a subdued, modernist scheme? The saturation of your colors is the key to this.

Hue

The hue dimension determines which actual color to show as represented by color names such as red, green, and blue. The HSL hue dimension goes from 0 to 360,  representing degrees on a circular color spectrum (LINK). As mentioned in a previous chapter, there is no coherent theory about which hue combinations produce harmonic results. Although many have tried, it is impossible to make a generalized theory about such a thing (O'Connor, Zena (2010) Color Harmony Revisited, p. 267-273. Color Research and Application. Volume 35, Issue 4). However, it can be beneficial to draw some conclusions from how hue combinations exist in the real world.

In nature, we often see small hue differences in the red-green parts of the color spectrum. In the spring, trees and plants will take on an almost monochrome bright green color scheme, but as the season turns to fall, these colors will spread slightly into a multitude of analogous colors of green, yellow, and red. You will often find such hue combinations in design products looking to evoke feelings of tranquility or peace, such as yoga studios, organic food products, and wedding invitations. A different type of analogous color scheme can be found in photos from outer space, where brighter colors in the blue/green parts of the spectrum create an almost alien effect. These colors are often used in technology or software products that want to appear streamlined and deliberately manufactured. It is not a coincidence that Apple and Microsoft stores look like the inside of a spaceship: They are designed to make customers feel like they entered a state-of-the-art science lab, because it makes them accept the higher price point. These are two types of color schemes with colors close to each other on the spectrum, but with very different visual effects.

A more profound effect happens when the distance between hues is increased. However, this statement can be deceiving. Although colors close to each other have a nice, analogous effect, colors on opposite sides of the color circle do not necessarily have the most pronounced hue contrast. The visual effect of two hues cannot be interpreted alone, as much is determined by the actual hues chosen, how they are used in a design, as well as their saturation and lightness values.

WRITE SOMETHING ABOUT THE EXAMPLE BELOW WHEN IT IS DONE.

We cannot discuss the hue dimension without mentioning the various types of color blindness that makes it hard for many to distinguish certain hues. The most prevalent color blindness is red-green, which makes it hard to distinguish red and green hues from each other. If the green retina cone is severely damaged, some people can only see the color blue. A more infrequent type of color blindness is blue-yellow, where blue, yellow, and green is indistinguishable. Also, in the rarest of cases, some people have complete monochrome vision. Up to 8% of men and 0.5% of women worldwide suffer from color blindness (Gegenfurtner, Karl. R.; Sharpe, Lindsay. T. (2001) Color Vision: From Genes to Perception, p. 3-11. Cambridge University Press). This means that a color scheme, especially one needed for instructional use, should not rely solely on hues to create color contrasts. Lightness should always be considered, as the ability to distinguish colors by contrast is shared by almost anyone who are not vision-impaired.

Color scheme examples

These three dimensions of color can inspire a lifetime of experiments with color combination. While some color schemes consist of colors that only vary in one of these dimensions (such as monochrome designs), most color schemes combine changes in hue, saturation, and lightness to achieve a palette of colors. This is demonstrated in the two examples below that combine techniques from above to create two very different color schemes.

The Brooklyn-based chocolate producer Mast Brothers is famous for their colorful packaging designs where colored patterns are used to denote the flavor profile of the chocolate. These patterns provide a great case study of how the three dimensions of color can be manipulated to create different expressions.


   Smoke                                   Mint                                       Brooklyn Blend

The first pattern is for a dark chocolate made with smoked beans, and the designer has chosen a high-contrast, monochrome color scheme with wavelike shapes to imply smoke floating in the air. Notice how these colors do not seem ‘natural’ per se, but are chosen to convey the taste of the product. The second pattern is for a dark chocolate with mint leaves and features a gradient of colors changing in hue and lightness from dark green to bright yellow with a constant saturation in the 50’s. The gradient provides for an interesting way of visualizing the two distinct flavors that despite their different characteristics blend well together. The final pattern features a four-color scheme on top of a lighter background where saturated colors with a high hue distance are used to color paint-like shapes. A playful and creative design for the borough of Brooklyn.

Procedural color schemes

So far we have manually hard-coded color values to create color schemes. To really take advantage of the fact that we are using code to generate these designs, we should investigate how to procedurally generate these colors. That is, use a loop to create a lot of colors in just a few lines of code. This means looking at the color() function and how to dynamically create color objects with a for loop.

The color() function in P5.js can be used to create a reusable color object, that can be used in the fill() and stroke() functions again and again. This means that, rather than having the same color values scattered throughout the code, we can assign a single color object to a variable on top of our code, and refer to this variable whenever the color needs to be used. Consider the following code where the same red color is used multiple times.

	CODE

This example can be rewritten using the color() function, so the color values only appear once in the code.

	CODE WITH COLOR OBJECT

To use the color() function with HSLuv values, we need to create a small function that performs the HSLuv to RGB conversion before creating the color object. Besides the use of the color() function, this function is identical to the fillHSluv() and strokeHsluv() functions from the last chapter (LINK).

	Function colorHsluv() {}
	// USE IT

Now, what if we want to use multiple colors in a design? It would make sense to just add more variables to the code above. Although that is perfectly fine for just a few colors, it does not make sense for a large number of colors. In this scenario, it is more sensible to use a single array that allows for colors to be added and removed without introducing new variables. The code below stores three colors in a single array and uses them to draw a color scheme.

	Var colors = []
	USE THEM WITH THE SAME 3-BOX DESIGN AS BEFORE
Finally, we can replace the hard-coded lines of color code with a loop that dynamically puts just as many objects into the array as we want. We do this by starting out with an empty array, and adding a new color object to the array on every loop iteration. The result is a 3-color scheme with completely random colors.

	RANDOM COLS CODE

With all these concepts in place, we are ready to procedurally generate color schemes. One strategy – which is probably also the simplest – is to stick with the random() function and create different types of color schemes by changing the min and max values used with random(). This will sometimes result in duplicate colors (because we cannot guarantee that the random() function will not return the same number twice), but it is a nice, quick way to move away from hard-coded color schemes.

[ COLORFUL COLOR SCHEME WITH RANDOM ]
Captions

A more powerful strategy is to use the loop’s incrementing i variable to create the values passed to the color() function. This technique is identical to what was demonstrated in the procedural shapes chapter (LINK), but this time we use it for color values and not x and y positions. The example below demonstrates how to use i to create colors with X distance in lightness while keeping the saturation and hue constant.

[ COLOR SCHEME WITH MONOCHROME ]

Here, the same technique is used in all dimensions.

[ COLOR SCHEME WITH ALL DIMENSIONS ]

This technique is not only an excellent way to quickly test different color schemes while ideating. It can also be used to create precise color guides for branding systems or other types of design manuals. Google’s Material Design document has a range of color swatches that designers at Google (and elsewhere) can use to standardize colors across products while also ensuring that their color schemes have proper contrast. Programming languages are excellent tools for making these types of swatches, especially if you are using a perceptually uniform color library like HSLuv.

This color swatch, etc….

This code can become even more flexible by adding a few variables to store the base hue and spacing between the colors. Rather than hardcoding these two variables, we can introduce the random() function to create a dynamic color scheme that looks different every time the code runs. The random() function is also used to create a bit of variation in saturation and lightness. These six colors schemes are all created with the same code shown below.

	CODE AND SIX OUTPUTS
	// INLINE COMMENTS

We are of course not bound to create all colors within the loop. The color scheme below has two colors created in the loop while a third accent color with an opposite hue is added after the loop has run. The possibilities are endless once the basic concepts are learned.

	ACCENT CODE WITH 4 OUTPUTS

We cannot end this chapter without discussing another useful technique for procedural color generation – the lerp() function – which can be used to calculate transitions from one color to another. The lerp() function has nothing to do with color, as it can be used to calculate any number between two numbers. The function expects – besides the two range numbers – an interpolation amount that is used to calculate the resulting number. An interpolation amount of 0 will return the first number, 0.5 will return the number midway between the two numbers, and 1 will return the second number.

LERP() //=>
LERP() //=>
LERP() //=>

As a digital color consists of three numerical values, we can use this function three times to calculate any color between two colors. It is important to note that P5.js has a colorLerp() function that performs this calculation in just one line of code. However, it only works with built-in color modes and therefore not the HSLuv library. The example below finds the color exactly midway between a dark XX and a lighter XXXX.

	CODE

This technique is even more helpful when used in combination with a loop, where the interpolation amount can be calculated by dividing ‘i’ by its largest possible value. This is no different than calculating a ratio between two numbers by division (e.g. 2 / 10 is 0.2), but because this calculation is performed over and over with an incrementing ‘i’ value, it will produce interpolation amounts all the way from 0 to 1 with the number of steps determined by how many times the loop runs. This is demonstrated below where the technique is used to create a copy of the Mint chocolate gradient shown earlier in this chapter.

	MINT GRADIENT

This chapter introduced techniques to help designers explore the color spectrum through the hue, saturation, and lightness dimensions of the HSL color model. Using these techniques, designers can move away from the 2D color solid known from the color picker, and approach color combination by focusing on the relationship between colors in a 3D space. Whether these techniques are used to quickly test different color combinations, or built directly into digital design products, they are another important tool for a designer wanting to treat design as a systematic art.

Exercise
Design a simple book cover for one of your favorite books. The design should use basic or custom shapes, but no typography. Once you have a design that conveys something in the storyline, consider which type of color scheme is needed to support your design. Keep in mind that a science fiction thriller might need very different colors than a romance novel. Then, color the shapes in your design using the techniques presented in this chapter. Rather than hard-coding the colors, try to make a design where the color scheme is different every time the sketch runs. The exercise is to make a dynamic color scheme where each iteration still fits storyline.
