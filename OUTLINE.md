Introduction
------------

- ADD: Data viz to how products are changing.
- ADD: modular content.
- ADD: P5.js section
- ADD: About magicbook
- Quick introduction to P5.js

Shape
-------------

- A Short History of Graphic Design

Color
-------------

- A Short History of Color Theory
- Color Models and Color Spaces
- Generating Color Schemes
- Color Accessibility


Layout
-------------

- Ratios
  - Law of thirds

Repetition
-------------

- Introduction (and history?)
- Column and row repetition
  - Using nested for loops (Paul Rand hearts example)
  - Using randomization (Paul Rand I know example)
  - Using col and row to create gradients / color changes
- Recursion and non-repeatable patterns

Randomization
-------------

- Introduction (and history?)
- Basic randomization
  - Techniques for dynamic designs: Size, color, etc

Typography (or Text? go through generative text examples?)
----------

- Dexter Sinister - letter and spirit
- Dave crossland - metapolator

Data
----

- A Short History of Information Design
  One of the biggest demands ... is the ability to parse and display data...
  - Stuff from talks: Minard, data viz, etc
- Graphs (stuff to use for workshops too)

Motion

3D
-------------

Interaction
-----------

- Introduction, history of user interfaces, etc
- Mouse

Intelligence
-------------------

Section about machine learning, etc?

Case Studies
------------

A section that all other chapters can link to, with examples of work that has been re-created in code. It's in its own section because all of the implementation use techniques from all the chapters.

- Giovanni Pintori - Olivetti poster
- A Sagmeister
