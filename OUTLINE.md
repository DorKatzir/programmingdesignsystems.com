  - .... different grids

Repetition
-------------

- Introduction (and history?)
  - Using i for spacing, etc...

  - Using nested for loops (Paul Rand hearts example)
  - Using randomization (Paul Rand I know example)
  - Using col and row to create gradients / color changes
- Recursion and non-repeatable patterns

Randomization
-------------

- Introduction (and history?)
- Basic randomization
  - Techniques for dynamic designs: Size, color, etc

Typography (or Text? go through generative text examples?)
----------

Data
----

- Introduction
  One of the biggest demands ... is the ability to parse and display data...

Interaction
-----------

- Introduction, history of user interfaces, etc
- Mouse

Design Intelligence
-------------------

Section about machine learning, etc?

Case Studies
------------

A section that all other chapters can link to, with examples of work that has been re-created in code. It's in its own section because all of the implementation use techniques from all the chapters.
